  ### TL;DR

  The Book Cow is a small, independent book store located in one of Canberra’s oldest suburbs.

  <br>This project set out to explore how a measured approach to user experience could transform the store’s e-commerce experience by satisfying twin goals — delivering on customer expectations, and providing a similar sense of delight to that of the bricks and mortar location.

  ### Overview

  #### Team and duration

  This was a solo project. My role as a UX designer focused on business analysis, content strategy and UI design.

  #### Methods

  Competitive and comparative analysis, heuristic analysis, user research, user flow mapping, system mapping, prototyping and usability testing.

  ### “It just feels so clunky”

  The Book Cow is unique in its physical environment - a place to share the joy of reading nestled amongst a slew of cafes and eateries.

  <br>Sense of community is important to the business, and is fostered through the store’s involvement with its local schools, as well as the frequent book launches and signings held on site.

  <br>Unfortunately, none of this is immediately apparent to visitors of The Book Cow’s website.

  <br>Further, product discovery is hampered by a lacklustre search experience, and the process of making a book purchase online is bogged down with too many steps — oftentimes unimportant to the customers making them.

</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

  ### Simple solutions

  The designed solution focused on three key areas:
  1. Presenting a cohesive experience by revisiting how the store organised and presented its own content.
  2. Pairing pages with people by making product discovery easier and more powerful.
  3. Streamlining the purchasing process by removing unnecessary friction and adding accelerators for busier customers.

  ### Invite early feedback

  Given the short timeframe in which the project was conducted, I focused on what could provide the most ‘bang for buck’ when selecting the right tools to explore the problem.

  <br>One of the most useful approaches undertaken was inviting early feedback on the prototypes I produced around the redesigned search experience.

  <br>Discovering how different audiences refined their queries was enlightening, and lead to the inclusion (and exclusion) of attributes I may not have otherwise thought of.

</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

  ### Building trust

  The Book Cow primarily engages with its audience via social media, somewhat orphaning the website and it’s visitors from some fantastic in-house content.

  <br>Initial research discovered that visitors were confused why in-page links took them to new windows (such as the online store for example), and weren’t aware that book signings and launches were scheduled to take place.

  <div class="my-10">
    {% figure 'bookcow--ia', "The redesigned site map", "The proposed IA positioned the website as the online heart of the business, supported (not out-shone) by other channels." %}
  </div>

  Visitors are now informed of upcoming events, a place is given for the unique perspectives given by employees on recent releases, and children’s interests are prominently positioned — just as they are in store.

</div>

### Find the right book, fast

  The original store interface was quite limiting in its ability to surface the right type of product, with just book categories available to help narrow down a request.

  <br>I examined what data was already available in the Book Cow’s inventory management system and expanded the search experience to include commonly filtered attributes, like price and availability. I also reduced the amount of categories shown at one time to reduce cognitive load.

  <div class="my-10">
    {% figure 'bookcow--search', "Redesigned search panel", "The proposed search interface" %}
  </div>

  Visual cues were added to help guide a user on what was currently being used to refine their result. These form part of an important usability heuristic aimed at providing the user with a sense of control over the UI.

  ### Accelerate the checkout process

  The Book Cow’s current checkout flow can be a meandering mess of frustration. Online customers must often input information that isn’t necessary to complete their purchase, and making changes to that data requires clicking through each step again in series.

  <div class="my-10">
    {% figure 'bookcow--guestcheckout', "Checkout as a guest proposal", "The ability to ‘checkout as a guest’ was introduced to appeal to speed and efficiency needs, removing friction from the purchasing experience by speeding the process up." %}
  </div>

  <div class="my-10">
    {% figure 'bookcow--checkout', "Checkout page proposal", "A checkout co-pilot was also added to the purchasing flow. At a glance we’re given an overview of what we’re buying, the data we’ve already provided, and any information still outstanding that’s required to complete the purchase." %}
  </div>

  <div class="my-10">
    {% figure 'bookcow--cta', "Checkout button proposal displaying differences between enabled and disabled", "Visibility of system status is an important usability heuristic. By communicating the current state of our system we build trust, which can help users feel empowered and engaged." %}
  </div>

  {% pagebreak %}

</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

  ### Final Thoughts

  Books are an interesting product. You’re very likely to get the same thing no matter where you buy it from, which leaves a store like The Book Cow with two ways to differentiate itself from the competition — price and experience.

  <br>By understanding customer needs and designing experiences to meet them, businesses such as the Book Cow can not only improve their bottom line, but further their engagement with the community they operate in.
