testimonial: Ryan is a straight talker.  My experience working with him is that he's never afraid to tackle the 'hard stuff' and is always open minded to a solution.  Nothing appears insurmountable to him and his UX approach is thoughtful and always backed up by research from real user feedback.  It's a pleasure to work with him.

### TL;DR 💨

Otivo, an Australian business offering licensed online financial advice, challenged a colleague and myself to improve their service before its upcoming launch.<br>
Over three weeks, we analysed the business and it’s customers to present a solution aimed at familiarising new users to the service by personalising their first touch points.

### The kick-off meeting 🏉

<div class="mb-10">
{% respimg 'otivo--dogs', "Two dogs meeting eachother on a street" %}
</div>

Like most things in life, achieving a good outcome is usually the result of careful planning.<br>
You essentially create your own luck.<br>
Going in to the kick-off meeting, my colleague and I had prepared a list of questions we needed to know about the business and its users. We wanted to know what goals the business had, and importantly, what success would look like for them.<br>
We also wanted to better define what constraints the project would come with — we knew time wasn’t on our side, but would there be anything else?<br>
Successful design solutions consider not only the end user, but the business delivering the service. Failing to understand that could have the project missing the mark by a large margin, and wasn’t something we were prepared to let happen.

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

### Exploring the problem space 🧭

Armed with a better understanding of the business, it’s users, and the constraints the project was bundled with, we could start exploring the problem space.<br>
We started off by actually using the product.<br>
In doing so we also took the time to conduct a quick heuristic analysis — testing the service against an established set of design principles. From a time investment standpoint, this activity paid off big time - we discovered some concerns with accessibility, error recovery and slip prevention, all giving us opportunities to build from.<br>
Following on from our heuristic analysis, we then examined some other companies operating in a similar space to Otivo. We found several examples where information was displayed in easy to scan formats, supported with enough density to quickly convey what the product did, and how it could benefit a potential customer, both things Otivo could improve on.

<div class="my-10">
{% figure 'otivo--market-analysis', 'Two competitors of Otivo', "Examining similar sites allowed us to consider Jakob’s Law — that people spend more time on sites other than your own" %}
</div>

These activities helped form our assumptions about the initial state of the service, and the direction we believed might be the most helpful to explore going forward.

</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

### Testing assumptions 🧑‍🔬

Our initial assumptions were that Otivo wasn’t conveying their value proposition early enough via it’s website, that the signup process didn’t take advantage of the excitement a user should experience at that point in their journey, and finally that the onboarding process could be improved to better familiarise a user with the service.<br>

<div class="my-10">
{% figure 'otivo--journeymap', "Customer journey map detailing a users' first experience with Otivo", "The customer journey map detailing a hypothetical users' first experience with Otivo" %}
</div>

Our next step was to see if that’s what users thought too.

> “I have no idea what to do now...”

<br>The usability test can be one of the most powerful activities a UX designer has in their toolbox to quickly cut through bullshit and discover how well a design is working. Ours discovered that people couldn’t really articulate the services Otivo offered, and that the onboarding experience in particular was a huge area requiring improvement — with most users unsure what their next step should be.

<br>Confidence buoyed, we took our results to the client and discussed directions for the remainder of the project.

<br>We put forth three ideas that we’d like to explore further:

1. Revisit the website to better convey Otivo’s value proposition
2. Leveraging user engagement during the signup process to provide a smoother handoff when onboarding
3. Overhaul the onboarding experience, aiming to reduce ‘time to value’ for the user

</div>

### Selling ideas 🤑

We thought that all three of our recommendations had enough merit to pursue in their own right. We also knew that we didn’t have the time to dedicate to each of them and produce a good result.

> “Do it nice, or do it twice”

<br>Part of being a good designer is being able to sell your ideas. We presented each recommendation in turn and stated why we thought each had value, but cautiously guided more attention to the onboarding experience. We believed that was the biggest bang for buck area we could focus on — and so did the client, calling us back two hours after our chat and agreeing with our thoughts.

<br>With an idea locked in for our remaining time, we condensed our research and ideas into a design hypothesis.

> "If we develop an onboarding process that guides a new user around the features of Otivo and introduces them to some common tasks, then they’ll likely continue subscribing after the trial period finishes.
> <br>We'll know this to be true when new user retention rate increases by 5%."

### Putting pen to paper ✍️

The next stage of the project rushed by quite quickly in comparison. We ideated design concepts, created a working prototype and tested it in the crucible of user feedback.

<div class="my-10">
{% figure 'otivo--persona', "Early wireframe example", "Early wireframes guiding prototype development" %}
</div>

<div class="my-10">
{% figure 'otivo--wireframe2', "Early wireframe example", "Prototype fidelity increased as our level of thinking did" %}
</div>

How was it received?

<br>Really well — user’s enjoyed self-identifying with a particular financial archetype, and the tailored onboarding experience that resulted in that choice. We found the density of information we were presenting was close to the mark when it came to the common questions on a user’s mind throughout the journey.
We also found there was more to do, with expectations differing when it came to which interface element was introduced first.

### Wrapping up 👌

The next challenge was how to finalise the project and complete a handover with the client.

<br>We’d been quite forthcoming with our communication throughout the project, so we decided the final handover meeting need not be anything too in depth — settling on a simple 15 minute presentation in the end. We briefly recapped the process we carried out, brought attention to some insights uncovered during each stage of the project, and closing with some recommendations and next steps Otivo could take.

<br>The client was thrilled.
