### The client

[Visit Canberra](http://visitcanberra.com.au/){.link} aims to grow the visitor economy for Canberra by highlighting events, attractions and local businesses to prospective tourists.

### The challenge ðŸ‘€

Utilise modern web technology to integrate the [Australian Tourism Data Warehouse](https://atdw.com.au/){.link} and provide a canvas for content-creators to champion brand Canberra.<br>
Visit Canberra is a SPA built using Vue.js, the front-end consuming data from a Drupal 9 back-end in a headless capacity.

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9 mt-12">
{% figure 'visit-canberra--10Things', 'Major Canberra attractions', 'Visit Canberra utilises lists to promote discoverability' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10">

### The result ðŸ‘Œ

The development process presented numerous hurdles which emphasised the importance of client communication.  Fortunately we were able to work toward the solution together - something that may not have happened if that communication had broken down.
