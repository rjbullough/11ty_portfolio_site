### The client

[4 Canberra](http://4canberra.com.au/){.link} aims reignite the local tourism economy post COVID-19 by cross-promoting four different attractions in the region.

### The challenge ðŸ‘€

Provide a simple way of distributing EDM to attraction visitors, encouraging them to visit all of the participating operators during the promotional period.

I used Mailchimp to provide targeted material to visitors, highlighting attractions they hadn't yet visited amongst the group - all handled through a simple QR check-in code.

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10 mt-12">
{% figure '4canberra--attractions', 'Picture of the four participating tourism venues taking place in 4Canberra', 'The tourism operators taking part in the initiative' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

### The result ðŸ‘Œ

A simple, scalable solution developed in an incredibly short timeframe.
