  ### TL;DR 💨

  ID Care help victims recover from scam attacks and identity theft. They have a wealth of knowledge on the topic, but it’s hard to find and isn’t presented in a cohesive manner.

  <br>Using interviews and surveys to understand current behaviours, a colleague and myself suggested a three pronged approach to help ID Care—
  1. Better market themselves
  2. More easily educate their audience
  3. Encourage small habits for individuals to protect themselves

  ### Overview

  #### The client

  ID Care, in their own words —

  > “have helped thousands of Australian and New Zealand individuals and organisations reduce the harm they experience from the compromise and misuse of their identity information by providing effective response and mitigation.”

  <br>This project set out to understand how ID Care might help the same individuals they serve from becoming victims in the first place.

  <br>This project was conducted for educational purposes only.


  #### Team and duration

  This project was conducted by myself and one other student, both studying UX design. It took place over two weeks as part of our coursework whilst studying with General Assembly Australia.

  #### Methods

  Market analysis, user research, content strategy, information architecture analysis, wire-framing, prototyping and usability testing.

  ### Identity security — what’s that? 🧐

  Successful products or services must be both useful, and usable to their audience. Great design solutions need to consider that audience, but also the business that offers them.

  <br>Our team didn’t fully understand the landscape that ID Care operated in, so our first port of call was to learn more about Identity security. In doing so, we could better design solutions that both met user expectations, and aligned with business goals.

  ### We’re in the response and recovery business ❤️‍🩹

  Our deep-dive in to ID Care proved immensely useful. We gained a greater understanding of the impacts that both identity theft and scam attacks have on Australians — over $850 million dollars in financial loss in 2020 alone.

  <br>We also gained a greater appreciation of the current direction the business operates in — with a focus on what happens AFTER an individual (or organisation) has had their identity compromised. Our initial design hypothesis considered what might happen if we shifted more awareness on prevention instead.

  <br>Searching through the website also allowed us to conduct a brief heuristic analysis, making the most of our time by killing two birds with one stone. There were some obvious quick wins that could be made with the way information was organised, and the language used when delivering it. By considering our audience’s mental models, we can more effectively deliver content that aligns with their way of processing information.

  <div class="my-10">
  {% figure 'idcare--scambulance', "ID Care used strange words like 'scamulance' to describe their services", "ID Care didn't speak the same language as it's users, leading to things like the 'scambulance'." %}
  </div>

  ### Targeted, vulnerable and without a care in the world 👶

  With a better understanding of the business and its goals, we set out to explore the people who interact with the service.

  <br>Australians count themselves amongst the most targeted populations in the world from identity theft and scam attacks. Our propensity for trust, as well as our relative isolation from one another in regional areas are both incredibly enticing for those looking to take advantage of individuals.

  <br>We designed a survey to discover the personal impact felt from identity theft scam attacks, participants level of knowledge around the various types of attacks used, and how well they felt they were doing about keeping their identities secured. Results were somewhat surprising — social media being the main source of education for the topic, and most people (over 70%) not feeling like they were doing enough to secure their identity online.

  <div class="my-10">
  {% figure 'idcare--survey', "Pie graph displaying results of a survey", "Reasons for this figure included: lack of interest, time constraints, or the feeling that it’s just not a serious enough topic to worry about" %}
  </div>

  Armed with this knowledge, we conducted a series of user interviews to better understand those sentiments.

</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

  ### Changing minds, winning hearts 🙌

  The best user interviews are usually the result of careful planning, active listening and an enjoyable experience for the participant — nobody wants to feel like they’re being quizzed!

  <div class="my-10">
  {% respimg 'idcare--affinity', "Affinity mapping post-it notes", "zoomable" %}
  </div>

  Throughout the process, we quickly saw a theme that our participants didn’t fully understand the potential implications as a result of identity theft or scam attacks.
  Simple story telling often opened their eyes to the dangers present around the topic.

  <br>With that in mind, our design solution started to become a little clearer.

### Now trending — scam advice 📈

  ID Care doesn’t have a huge presence on social media — a few twitter posts, and a smattering of facebook posts without a real sense of cohesion.

  <br>We hypothesised that a content strategy that utilised victim stories, of which ID Care had over 100,000 of, would drive people to empathise and become more involved in their own safety.

  <br>We quickly ideated what those could look like and tested the results with more participants.

  ### A place for everything, everything in it's place 📦

  ID Care’s information about the types of scam and identity theft attacks circulating in Australia weren’t presented in a coherent fashion. An interested party would have to search through past newsletters, fact sheets, news articles and videos to become fully informed.

  <br>We knew we’d need to address that following on from our social media initiative, providing a single location to consume information about the particular topic an individual was engaged with.

  <br>Our recommendation here was to leverage the wealth of information already available, condense it into a single location, and present it all in the same fashion aligning to a user’s goal — quickly becoming informed.

  <div class="my-10">
    {% figure 'idcare--wireframe', "Early wireframe example", "Each individual scam fact sheet would be displayed in a consistent matter" %}
  </div>

  {% pagebreak %}

  ### Did it all work? 🧐

  We can’t be sure if our design solutions ultimately solved the goal of helping ID Care prevent Australians from falling victim to scam or identity theft attacks — it was, after all, an education project.

  <br>We did test our solutions of course, and received hugely positive feedback that it was easier to learn about how these attacks are typically carried out — but there was still a lot of work to do!

  <br>The important take-away is that feedback should drive the next round of change and iteration, each time further refining and coming closer to perfection.
